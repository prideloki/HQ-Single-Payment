I usually don't upload `vendor/` since it is generated by `composer install` command, but in order to make it work from cloning the repo without installing anything. I have to add 'vendor/' in the repo.

## How to install
run this command 
```
./composer install
```
## How to run test
```
vendor/bin/phpunit 
```
## Improvement:
- should add validation in the server-side
